=head1 NAME

Devel::FIXME::Rules::PerlFile - Support for rules stored as perl code in a file.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	% vim ~/.fixme/rules.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The file in the L<SYNOPSIS>, or the file specified by the C<FIXME_RULEFILE>
environment variable, needs to return an array reference, containing code
references.

These code references are the rules that are applied as methods on the fixme
object.

=head1 EXAMPLE

This is a really silly rules file, but it does show what you can do:

	[
		sub {
			my $self = shift;
			# discard any file that is writable (assume not checked in to SCM)
			return DROP unless -w $self->{file};
		},
		sub {
			my $self = shift;
			# any FIXME's in my dir are warned about
			return SHOUT if $self->{file} =~ m!my/src/dir/!;
		},
	];

The fixme object contains some fields. See L<Devel::FIXME>'s implementation.
